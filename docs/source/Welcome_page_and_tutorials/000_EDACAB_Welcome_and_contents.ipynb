    "The data-driven conference is a new way of sharing research insights which is designed to promote collaboration, innovation and research transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conference is split into two events:\n",
    "* Data analysis competition - A one day event where researchers work together to identify damage within a range of experimental and real-world data sets.\n",
    "* Half-day conference - A chance for researchers to share their work and the outputs from the data analysis competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional academic conferences, the data-driven conference allows you to share analysis code and data when presenting your research. Attendees can run the analyses in real-time and share their own insights and expertise."

    "Rather than submitting a conventional conference paper attendees are invited to submit a Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter notebooks blend conventional images and text with blocks of code that allow readers to understand the analysis methods and how they're applied.
