    "## Creating Jupyter Notebooks with Deepnote\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are split into *markdown blocks* and *code blocks*, examples of which are shown in the image below. Markdown blocks allow you to add formatted text, images, equations and tables. Code blocks allow you to add Python or R scipts to your document.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note**: To allow easy commenting it is good practice to split each section of the Jupyter Notebook into smaller blocks, rather than having one block which include all markdown text or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting text in Deepnote markdown blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "To create titles add \"#\" at the start of the line of text. To create headings and subheadings use multiple hashtags i.e. \"##\", \"###\" or \"####\". To make text *italic* place a \"\\*\" either side of the text. To make text **bold** place \"\\*\\*\" either side of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding equations to Deepnote markdown blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations in Jupyter Notebooks use LaTex formatting, place a dollar sign \"\\\\$\" either side of an equation. Equations can be in-line, such as $y=mx+C$ or can be seperated on a new line, as shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deepnote code blocks behave like any other Python interpreter. We can import libraries, define functions and plot graphs. If we want to run all code blocks we use the *run notebook* button at the top of the screen. If we want to run only a single block we use the small play button on the right hand side of the block, shown in the image below. \n",

    "### Adding comments to Deepnote\n",
    "\n",
    "To comment on a markdown or code block, select the *comment* button (speech bubble) on the right-hand side of the block. All comments on the notebook can be viewed usngg the *comments* tab of the right-hand sidebar, shown in the image below.\n",
