    "[Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) is a cloud-based computational notebook service developed by EDINA at the University of Edinburgh. \n",
    "\n",
    "Noteable provides an online hub for hosting Jupyter Notebooks and allows users to code directly in their browser in a selected range of coding languages. Noteable makes it easy to create and share your research methods through combining the readability of traditional written documents with the interactivy of dynamic coding notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing and using Noteable to produce Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to Noteable is provided via [Learn](learn.ed.ac.uk), the University of Edinburgh's virtual learning environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1. Request access to Noteable** \n",
    "\n",
    "To access the EDACAB Noteable service you first have to request access from [Dr Zach Wynne](z.wynne@sms.ed.ac.uk).\n",
